### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am **Oleg Iarygin**, a postgrad student of Computer Science who builds up a portfolio
here and resolves use case pains in other projects. Also I have a miraculous
ability to use stuff in unintended ways without being aware of it, so I
constantly meet lags and crashes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web browser that doesnâ€™t freeze as heavy as
  Chromium on my 4GB RAM 500GB HDD *work*station.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning low-level NT API because classical Windows network
  API is partially synchronous and has thick multilayer wrappers for
  compatibility I donâ€™t need. However, this knowledge has no use if the
  application is for Windows Store.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on C or C++ desktop or network backend projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with searching of Russia-hosted analog of Google
  Firebase for my Russia-only projects because of ping.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mitigation of C qirks, how to port a static site to an ad-hoc
  Python generator, and how to preserve sanity in the process.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  oleg@arhadthedev.net,
  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arhadthedev),
  [VK](https://vk.com/arhadthedev) (the PM is open for everyone).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m a fan of Unreal Gold.

ðŸ§¼ Pro tip: keep hands sanitized after each rebase with
`git filter-branch --env-filter "GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=$GIT_AUTHOR_DATE"`.
